    <h1>Creamy White Chicken Chili</h1>
    <img src="../recipe_img/chili.jpg" alt="Creamy White Chicken Chili">

    <p>This simple one pot Creamy White Chicken Chili is the perfect bowl to warm up to on a cold fall/winter day. Made with poblano peppers, jalapeños (for just the right amount of heat), and shredded chicken. It’s spicy, creamy and so delicious. Top each
        bowl of chili with plenty of cheddar cheese, fresh cilantro, and avocado too. Great on its own, but even better with a side of homemade beer bread.</p>
